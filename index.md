# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on demand of Bike rentals](https://github.com/enessibest/Linear-regression-project/blob/main/Linear_Regression.ipynb)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [**55%** accuracy](https://github.com/enessibest/Linear-regression-project/blob/main/Linear_Regression.ipynb).

- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Cross Validation for validating the training data and model fit.

[Classifying if a customer will buy the term deposit or not using logistic regression](https://github.com/enessibest/Logistics-Regression-/blob/main/Logistics_regression_project.ipynb)

<img src="images/bank-data.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Using a bank data of a Portugues bank to classify if a customer will buy the term deposit or not using logistic regression model 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in [**91%** accuracy using Logistic Regression algorithm](https://github.com/enessibest/Logistics-Regression-/blob/main/Logistics_regression_project.ipynb).

- Used logistic regression to identify if a customer will buy the term deposit or not

- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve

[classifying Biomechanical Features of Orthopedic patients](https://github.com/enessibest/KNN-Naive-bayes/blob/main/K_NN_and_NB_project.ipynb)

<img src="images/knee-brace-ortho.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:** Classifying if a patient is normal or abnormal using K-NN and Naive Bayes classifier .

**Quantifiable result:** using this classifiers , we can attain an accuracy of [**88%** using K-nn and **77.42%** using Naive Bayes](https://github.com/suvo-gh/Cat_or_Dog_prediction/blob/main/CNN_Project%20(Image_Classification).ipynb).


- Training model on basis of given data using th K-NN and Naive Bayes algorithm

[Determining if the clicks of mobile advertisement is fraud or genuine ](https://github.com/enessibest/Bagging-and-Boosting/blob/main/Bagging_and_boosting_.ipynb)

<img src="images/advt.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas,SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** To predict the probabiltity of click being genuine or fraud based on given features using boosting and bagging technique.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the fraud and genuine clicks resulting in **81% accuracy**. using Bagging classifier and **92 % Accuracy** using XGBoost classifier

- Cleaned data
- Applied bagging classifier
- Apllied gradient boostclassifier model
- Calculated the accuracy of all the models

[To determine how to improve on their policies for employee benefits. ](https://github.com/enessibest/K-Means-Project/blob/main/data_link.md)

<img src="images/Fiscal.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas,SKlearn, Matplotlib,Seaborn

**Project Objective:** To predict on how to improve the organization policies for better employee benefits using the K-means technique.

**Quantifiable result:** Deriving a good number of clusters,We could predict  a better policies for employee benefits using K-Means Clustering classifier for a better accuracy 

    - cleaned  data 
    - applyed the K-means clustering method
    - derived the center of clusters
